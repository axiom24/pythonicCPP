# pythonicCPP
Convert ordinary c++ code to a more pythonic c++ using cpp14

It does not convert code to python or vice versa, just translates normal c++ code to readable Python flavoured code using libraries and features introduced in cpp11 and cpp14.
Things like Ranged-based for loops, type deduction, vector and map initializers, lambda expressions , std algorithms etc.
